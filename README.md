# About QPasm

The PASM Library (LibPASM) provides a simple pseudo-assembler interpreter. This library provides the building blocks for creating a small Integrated Development Environment for small pseudo-assembler programs.

QPasm makes use of the PASM Library to provide a small Integrated Development Environment for small pseudo-assembler programs.

Both LibPASM and QPasm are being developed by Wesley Stessens.

QPasm implements the same basic pseudo-assembler language as the one being taught in the first year at Hasselt University in the course "Computer systems". The only difference is that the implemented language in QPasm also supports labels to make programming easier.

QPasm is primarily used as a replacement for the older SCASM which was used for the course before.
